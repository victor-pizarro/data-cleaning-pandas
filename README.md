W1 Project - Data cleaning & wrangling

The purpose of this project is to combine what I learned about data wrangling, cleaning, and manipulation with Pandas and see how they all work together. For this project, I will start with this messy data set Shark Attack.

The data will be cleaned up and prepared for analysis with my data wrangling skills.

TO DO LIST
- Decide hypotheses with which i will clean the data.
- Explore the data and write down what i find.
- Create at least two graphs.

To do this project i used:
- Python
- Python's libraries: pandas, numpy, regex, seaborn and matplotlib.pyplot.
